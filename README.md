Custom widget / online resource HTML templates for SumTotal Maestro / Growth Edition


These are pages that have been created by SumTotal solution architects and made available to Growth Edition (Maestro) customers. These have been altered from their original format to be leveraged either in a widget or online resource in the LMS.

Any images included should be replaced with your own custom images. Similarly, links should be updated to your own links where applicable.

Comments where you can add your own edits have been added to this code and are identified by either a //, <!--, or /* notation.

There are plenty of places that the code can be tweaked to meet your needs or coding experience. For beginners, we recommend starting with updating the commented items. For more advanced users, there is normally a "styles" item that contains CSS in these pages that can alter the look and feel of the entire page.

To add or remove "items" on a page, items in an array (named like Icons[4] ) can be deleted or added to. Please remove from the bottom of these items up, removing the highest number. Incrementing should be done to add to the highest number. The code is designed to iterate through the array to add each item to the page.

As a heads up, you cannot add multiples of these widgets to the same widget page. Because of the overlap in naming conventions of the classes and variables, one of the items will render correctly and additional ones will not.

If you can think of any questions or would like to see something cleared up, please reach out and let me know. Thank you!
